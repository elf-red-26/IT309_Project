                <p>Fellowship Baptist Academy was founded by Dr. Demetrio Coloso Macasa, Sr. in 1953, with the goal of establishing a Christian academy that emphasized preaching and teaching the Word of God to young people. With the support of other Baptist lay leaders, the academy was established in 1954, with the help of American missionaries from the Association of Baptist for World Evangelism.</p>
                <p>Fellowship Baptist Academy (FBA) was a sectarian, non-stock, non-profit secondary school founded in the Philippines. It initially had 212 students, with a modest enrollment of 212. The school faced financial struggles but remained strong due to its foundation on the Lord Jesus Christ. The Board of Trustees and teachers sacrificially extended resources, and the school's pioneering spirit inspired them to serve the Lord in ministry.</p>
                <p>Fellowship Baptist Academy, despite facing challenges, successfully carried out its mission and received Government Recognition in 1957. Graduates have spread globally, with support from neighboring Baptist churches and Rev. Juan Catanus, Sr., the senior pastor of Kabankalan Fellowship Baptist Church, ensuring spiritual nourishment.</p>
                <p>The Board of Trustees and Principal Felipe A. Abogador converted a high school into a college, aiming to develop Christian youth. In 1983, a post-secondary course in Midwifery was introduced, which gained government recognition in 1985. In 1987, two degree programs were recognized, and the school was reclassified as a college in 1989-1990.</p>
                <p>In 1985, the Macasa Hall was built, housing most tertiary education offices and classrooms. The dedication of the Board of Trustees and religious groups led to its continuous development. In response to community needs, the school expanded basic education programs, offering Bachelor of Elementary and Bachelor of Secondary Education in 1999.</p>
                <p>Fellowship Baptist College in Kabankalan City, with a growing population and church membership, expanded its degree programs to reach young people through academic ministry. The school offered Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Accountancy, Civil Engineering, Computer Science, Psychology, Hospitality Management, Radiologic Technology, Computer Engineering, and Theology in 2003, 2006, and TESDA-affiliated courses like PC Operations NC II, Programming NC IV, Commercial Cooking NC II, Food and Beverage Services NC II, Housekeeping NC II, and Six-Month Caregiver NC II.</p>
